# Travel Request Application
## 1. Description
- This repository contains two travel applications (“Travel Request” and “Travel App”) with related objects and user interface components, approval processes for both apps, sample data for the Travel Request app, and JSON files for the Travel Request app’s related OmniStudio OmniScripts and FlexCards. 
- The main difference between the Travel Request app and the Travel app is that the latter does not feature OmniStudio components, while the former does.
- Both apps were created using a no-code approach and illustrate how Salesforce's declarative tools enable the rapid development of tailored, fully-interactive applications with process automation, analytics, and guided user experiences.
